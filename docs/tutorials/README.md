## Chapter Overview
- [Chapter 1 · Conceptual Foundations](chapter1_foundations.md)
- [Chapter 2 · Building a Linear Flow](chapter2_linear_flow.md)
- [Chapter 3 · Branching, Routing, and Loops](chapter3_routing_loops.md)
- [Chapter 4 · Fan-out, Joins, and Structured Inputs](chapter4_fanout_joins.md)
- [Chapter 5 · Configuration, Testing, and Operations](chapter5_operations.md)

## How to Use This Tutorial
1. Start with Chapter 1 to understand the guiding principles (payload-first design, fail-fast orchestration, declarative wiring).
2. Implement the minimal flow from Chapter 2 in your environment.
3. Iterate with Chapters 3 and 4 to add branching, loops, and joins.
4. Apply Chapter 5 when operationalising your flows (configuration sources, test discipline, runtime guard rails).
